Working in a large team is somewhat a struggle for many, managing large software projects is also a lot of pain, my other goal is to gain very useful experience in this light and to learn as much as I can while working with a lot of smart folks. I can't end this article without stating that, I also want to win The HNGi T-shirt ðŸ˜Š, which signifies quality work, grit, teamwork, and the ability to work under pressure and tight deadlines."
